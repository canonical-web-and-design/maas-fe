## About

MAAS is an open-source tool that lets you build a data centre from bare-metal servers. You can discover, commission, deploy, and dynamically reconfigure a large network of individual units.

This repository contains the sourcecode for the [MAAS](https://maas.io) web app, maas-ui.

It is comprised of the following [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/):

- _ui_: the react maas client (all new work should be in this workspace).
- _legacy_: the angularjs maas client.
- _root_: a single-spa app, providing top-level routing between both _ui_ and _legacy_.
- _shared_: code shared between both legacy and ui.
- _proxy_: a proxying express project, used for serving both legacy and ui projects in development.
