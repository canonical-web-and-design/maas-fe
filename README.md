## About
MAAS is an open-source tool that lets you build a data centre from bare-metal servers. You can discover, commission, deploy, and dynamically reconfigure a large network of individual units.

This repository contains the sourcecode for the [MAAS](http://maas.io) web app, maas-ui.

It is comprised of the following [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/):

  - *ui*: the react maas client (all new work should be in this workspace).
  - *legacy*: the angularjs maas client.
  - *shared*: code shared between both legacy and ui.
  - *proxy*: a proxying express project, used for serving both legacy and ui projects in development.
