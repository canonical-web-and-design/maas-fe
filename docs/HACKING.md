# Project conventions

## TypeScript

maas-ui built with TypeScript in strict mode. Any new modules in should be written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Dealing with problems

There are cases where determining a type for a particular object can be difficult. We provide an "escape hatch" type called `TSFixMe` (aliased to `any`) which you can use, but please make a best effort to avoid this and determine the correct types where possible.

# Development setup

**Note: You will need access to a running instance of MAAS in order to run maas-ui.**

## Set up a development container

### Start the instance

You may wish to use an existing instance, or you can [create a Multipass instance](#creating-a-multipass-instance) or [create a LXD instance](#creating-a-lxd-instance).

For now we'll assume you have an instance called "dev".

#### Multipass

Start your instance:

```shell
multipass start dev
```

Make sure your instance has [SSH credentials](#ssh-credentials) and then SSH into your machine, optionally with agent forwarding:

```shell
ssh [-A] multipass@dev.local
```

#### LXD

Start your instance:

```shell
lxc start dev
```

Connect to the instance as the provided `ubuntu` user:

```shell
lxc exec dev bash -- su ubuntu
```

### Clone the repository

If you're planning to contribute changes to maas-ui then first you'll need to make a fork of the [maas-ui project](https://github.com/canonical/maas-ui) in GitHub.

Then, inside your MAAS container clone the maas-ui repository.

```shell
git clone -o upstream git@github.com:canonical/maas-ui
cd maas-ui
git remote add origin git@github.com:<github-username>/maas-ui
```

Otherwise you can just use:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:canonical/maas-ui
cd maas-ui
```

### Edit local config

By default maas-ui will connect to `bolla.internal` which requires Canonical VPN access. Bolla runs on MAAS edge, which is the latest development version available.

If you wish to develop against a different MAAS then you can create a local env:

```shell
touch .env.local
```

Update the contents of that file to point to a MAAS. [See the section on MAAS deployments](#maas-deployments).

```shell
MAAS_URL="http://<maas-ip-or-hostname>:5240/"
```

The easiest way to run maas-ui is with [Dotrun](https://github.com/canonical/dotrun). You can install it with:

```shell
sudo snap install dotrun
```

You should now be able to run maas-ui and log into your MAAS:

```shell
dotrun
```

Once everything has built you can access the site using the hostname:

[http://dev.local:8400/MAAS/](http://dev.local:8400/MAAS/).

### Running a branch

To run a branch from a PR you can find and click on the link "command line instructions" and copy the command from "Step 1". It should look something like:

```shell
git checkout -b username-branch-name main
git pull https://github.com/username/maas-ui.git branch-name
```

Run those commands from the maas-ui dir (`cd ~/maas-ui`).

Then run the branch with:

```shell
dotrun
```

If something doesn't seem right you can try:

```shell
dotrun clean
dotrun
```

# MAAS deployments

## Canonical VPN deployments

If you have access to the Canonical VPN you can use one of the following MAAS deployments. You may need to do some [additional configuration](#vpn-configuration) inside your multipass instance.

Once connected to the VPN you can connect to one of the following MAAS deployments using the [credentials](https://wiki.canonical.com/WebAndDesign/DesignMaasLab).

### Karura

[karura.internal](http://karura.internal:5240/MAAS) (last stable release).

### Bolla

[bolla.internal](http://bolla.internal:5240/MAAS) (main)

## Local deployments

### Snap deployment

The easiest way to run a MAAS locally is using a snap. However, this method does not provide sample data and therefore will not have everything e.g. there will be no machines.

First you'll need to either [create a Multipass instance](#creating-a-multipass-instance) or [create a LXD container](#creating-a-lxd-container), call it something like "snap-maas".

Then enter the shell for that instance:

#### Multipass

```shell
multipass shell snap-maas
```

#### LXD

```shell
lxc exec snap-maas bash -- su ubuntu
```

Now install MAAS and a test database:

```shell
sudo snap install maas maas-test-db
```

Once that has completed you'll need to intialise the MAAS:

```shell
sudo maas init region+rack --database-uri maas-test-db:///
```

Now create a user:

```shell
sudo maas createadmin
```

You should now be able to access the MAAS in your browser:

[http://snap-maas.local:8400/MAAS/](http://snap-maas.local:8400/MAAS/).

You might now need to [configure maas-ui](#edit-local-config) to use this MAAS.

#### Updating a snap MAAS

To update your MAAS manually you can run:

```shell
sudo snap refresh maas
```

You can update to a different version with something like:

```shell
sudo snap refresh --channel=2.8 maas
```

### Development deployment

First you'll need to either [create a Multipass instance](#creating-a-multipass-instance) or [create a LXD container](#creating-a-lxd-instance), call it something like "dev-maas".

Then enter the shell for that instance:

#### Multipass

```shell
multipass shell dev-maas
```

#### LXD

```
lxc exec dev-maas bash -- su ubuntu
```

You'll need to fetch the current MAAS main:

```shell
git clone http://git.launchpad.net/maas
```

And then build and install a MAAS snap:

```shell
cd maas
sudo snap install maas-test-db
sudo apt install make
make install-dependencies
git config --file=.gitmodules submodule.src/maasui/src.branch main
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
make snap-prime
sudo snap try build/dev-snap/prime
utilities/connect-snap-interfaces
sudo maas init region+rack --maas-url=http://localhost:5240/MAAS --database-uri maas-test-db:///
```

You'll also need to create a user:

```shell
sudo maas createadmin
```

At this point you can [configure maas-ui](#edit-local-config) to use this maas with the default credentials (admin/test). If you wish to view the ui from that MAAS deployment you'll need to [build the UI](#running-maas-ui-from-a-development-maas).

#### Updating a development MAAS

To see any changes you've made inside the maas folder you'll need to run the
following:

#### Multipass

```shell
multipass shell dev-maas
```

#### LXD

```shell
lxc exec dev-maas -- su ubuntu
```

```shell
cd ~/maas
make sync-dev-snap
sudo service snap.maas.supervisor restart
```

#### Running maas-ui from a development maas

If you have previously built the UI then run:

```shell
cd ~/maas
make clean-ui
```

Optional: if you wish to use a specific branch of maas-ui then run:

```shell
git config --file=.gitmodules submodule.src/maasui/src.url https://github.com/[github-username]/maas-ui.git
git config --file=.gitmodules submodule.src/maasui/src.branch [branch name]
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
```

Optional: if you want to restore to maas-ui main then run:

```shell
git checkout .gitmodules
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
```

Now you can make the UI

```shell
make ui
```

Now you need to sync your changes and restart MAAS:

```shell
cd ~/maas
make sync-dev-snap
sudo service snap.maas.supervisor restart
```

You should now be able to access the MAAS in your browser:

[http://dev-maas.local:8400/MAAS/](http://dev-maas.local:8400/MAAS/).

# Creating a Multipass instance

## Install Multipass

First, install Multipass:

- [on Linux](https://multipass.run/docs/installing-on-linux), or
- [on a Mac](https://multipass.run/docs/installing-on-macos).

## Create the instance:

To be able to run maas-ui or MAAS you should allocate as many resources as you can to the instance. Don't worry, it'll share the CPU and RAM with the host and only take up the disk space it currently requires.

_Note: you can't increase the disk size once the instance has been created_

Check what resources your computer has and then run:

```shell
multipass launch -c [the number of cores] -d [some amount of disk space] -m [the amount of ram] --name [the instance name]
```

You should end up with a command something like this:

```shell
multipass launch -c 4 -d 20G -m 16G --name dev
```

## SSH credentials

You have two options for having SSH credentials in your Multipass instance.

### Host credentials

This method allows you to use the SSH credentials from your host machine and doesn't require you to create new SSH credentials for each Multipass instance.

You can follow [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) for setting up the ssh-agent.

Then you can log into your instance with:

```shell
ssh -A multipass@[instance-name].local
```

### Instance credentials

Access your instance with:

```shell
multipass shell [instance-name]
```

Then [generate a new SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and [add it to your Github account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

### macOS

#### VPN configuration

To connect to a remote MAAS over the VPN, you'll need to configure _nat_ on your macOS host:

1. run `ifconfig` and make note of the `utun` interfaces.
2. For every `utun` interface, add the following line to `/etc/pf.conf` directly after any existing `nat-anchor` or `nat` commands (the order is significant):

```shell
nat on utun0 from bridge100:network to any -> (utun0)
```

3. Run `sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf` to update configuration.
4. You should be able to `ping karura.internal` from your maas multipass.

Be aware that this may prevent reaching hosts on your internal network. You can of course comment out the `nat` configuration and rerun `sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf` to reset everything.

# Creating a LXD instance

## Install LXD on Linux

The recommended way to install LXD is with the snap. For the latest stable release, use:

```shell
snap install lxd
```

If you previously had the LXD deb package installed, you can migrate all your existing data over with:

```shell
lxd.migrate
```

See the [official LXD docs](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/#installation) for information on installing LXD on other OSes.

## Initialise LXD

By default, LXD comes with no configured network or storage. You can get a basic configuration suitable for MAAS with:

```shell
lxd init
```

## Launch the instance

You can launch an instance with the command `lxc launch`:

```shell
lxc launch imageserver:imagename instancename
```

For example, to create an instance based on the Ubuntu Focal Fossa image with the name `focal-maas`, you would run:

```shell
lxc launch ubuntu:20.04 focal-maas
```

See [the image server for LXC and LXD](https://us.images.linuxcontainers.org/) for a list of available images.

## Container credentials

Access your instance with:

```shell
lxc exec [container-name] bash -- su ubuntu
```

Then [generate a new SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and [add it to your Github account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

# Building

Ensure both node (current LTS) and yarn are installed.

From the root of the MAAS UI project run:

```shell
yarn build
```

An optimised production bundle will be built, and output to `./build`.

# Creating a fake windows image

You can create a fake Windows image if you need to test MAAS with a windows image (e.g. for managing license keys).

Note: you will need a local [development](#development-deployment) or [snap](#snap-deployment) MAAS.

Connect to you instance:

#### Multipass

```shell
multipass shell dev-maas
```

#### LXD

```shell
lxc exec dev-maas bash -- su ubuntu
```

## Create the image

Now create a fake Windows image:

```shell
dd if=/dev/zero of=windows-dd bs=512 count=10000
```

## Login to MAAS

You will need to log in to the CLI (if you haven't before).

You will be prompted for you API key which you can get from `<your-maas-url>:5240/MAAS/r/account/prefs/api-keys`.

#### Development MAAS

```shell
<path-to-maas-dir>/bin/maas login <new-profile-name> http://localhost:5240/MAAS/
```

#### Snap MAAS

```shell
maas login <new-profile-name> http://localhost:5240/MAAS/
```

## Upload the image

Ensure you have downloaded and synced an amd64 ubuntu image (via `<your-maas-url>:5240/MAAS/l/images`), this is required to populate architecture for the following step.

Now you can upload the image (remember to use `<path-to-maas-dir>/bin/maas/...` if you're using a development MAAS):

```shell
maas <profile-name> boot-resources create name=windows/win2012 title="Windows Server 2012" architecture=amd64/generic filetype=ddtgz content@=windows-dd
```

Then you should be able to visit `<your-maas-url>:5240/MAAS/l/images` and your Windows image should appear under the "Custom Images" section.

## License keys

If you're testing license keys the format is: `XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX`.

# Show intro

First you'll need to [log in](#login-to-maas) to the MAAS cli.

Then you reset the config to display the intro.

```shell
maas $PROFILE maas set-config name=completed_intro value=false
```

# Sample data

To use sample data with MAAS you'll first need to set up a [local MAAS](#local-deployments).

Next you'll need to get some sample data. The easiest way is to get a database dump [from CI](http://maas-ci.internal:8080/view/maas-sampledata-dumper/). Or alternatively you can [create a dump](https://github.com/maas/maas/blob/master/HACKING.rst#creating-sample-data).

Put the database dump onto your container and then run the following commands inside that container:

```shell
sudo cp path/to.dump /var/snap/maas-test-db/common/maasdb.dump
sudo snap run --shell maas-test-db.psql -c 'db-dump restore /var/snap/maas-test-db/common/maasdb.dump maassampledata'
sudo maas init region+rack --maas-url=${{env.MAAS_URL}}/MAAS --database-uri maas-test-db:///
sudo sed -i "s/database_name: maasdb/database_name: maassampledata/" /var/snap/maas/current/regiond.conf
sudo snap restart maas
```

Once MAAS has restarted you should be able to access the MAAS and see the data.

# Testing

## Integration tests

Integration tests currently run against the maas edge snap (main) [on github actions](https://github.com/canonical/maas-ui/actions?query=workflow%3ACypress) with [Cypress](https://cypress.io).

For details on developing integration tests, see the integration testing [README](/docs/INTEGRATION.md).

## Unit tests

Unit/integration tests use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing
Library](https://testing-library.com/), though many of our tests are still
written with [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/).

Tests can be run with:

```shell
dotrun test
```

To run tests and watch for changes you can pass `--watchAll=true` e.g.:

```shell
dotrun test --watchAll=true
```

You can run tests against a single file:

```shell
dotrun test NodeTestsTable.test.tsx
dotrun test NodeTestsTable
dotrun test --watchAll=true NodeTestsTable
```

To run a single test you can add `.only` to the test case or block.

_Note: this only limits the tests in a single file. You will also need to make sure you are only running that file._

```javascript
describe.only("NetworkTable", () => {
it.only("displays a spinner when loading", () => {
```

## Performance tests

Performance tests use [Sitespeed.io](https://www.sitespeed.io/) and are run when
PRs are merged.

Sitespeed can also be run manually, though the tests expect a MAAS with a
specific dataset. For best results a [local MAAS](#local-deployments) can be set
up using [sample data](#sample-data).

To run against a MAAS deployment you can use:

```shell
yarn sitespeed --browsertime.domain=[maas.ip.or.hostname]
```

To run against a local UI you will also need to set the port:

```shell
yarn sitespeed --browsertime.domain=[maas-ui.ip.or.hostname] --browsertime.port=8400
```
